                Sayu X has always gone big with his production. From the studio to the decks, Sayu’s signature, raw colour bass sound is very apparent in his careful selection and design. He gets his inspirations from artists like Chime, Skrillex, and especially Virtual Riot. In an interview, he shares “I think my biggest inspiration for the Spectrum EP was Virtual Riot's album: Simulation.” He also points out “how colourful and mesmerizing it was, both in terms of sound design and the melodic vibes it gave.”<br/><br/>

            <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
                Going off his inspiration, Sayu X explains, “I felt like, for my first EP, I wanted it to be just as colourful, or at least ATTEMPT to be as colourful as Simulation was.” His favourite track off the EP: Ethereal, is his first proper collaboration for his own project. Sayu X tells us “the song feels perfect in a way I can't translate into words. But I feel like Ethereal has really captured the spirit of Spectrum perfectly!”<br/><br/>

                This EP would not have been possible, or even nearly the same without JLYELI, who helped streamline the production on Ethereal, Heavenly, and Babblin’. JLYELI is a electronic producer based in Ontario, Canada who focuses primarily on making Dubstep, Colour Bass, and even a bit of tearout. He Co-owns recording label HEX Records together with his friend Boom, and He's been involved in music since he was three years old.<br/><br/>

                Sayu X’s message to share with the EP is: 
                “Life ain't fun without some colour in it, right? So, embrace the Spectrum of Life and enjoy it wholeheartedly!”
